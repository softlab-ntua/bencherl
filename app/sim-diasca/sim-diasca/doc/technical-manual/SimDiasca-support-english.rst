Sim-Diasca Support
------------------

It is not required to apply any meaningless procedure or know any code word to get some support:

:raw-html:`<img src="xkcd-tech_support.png"></img>`
:raw-latex:`\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{xkcd-tech_support.png}`


No need either for a specific support registration form:

:raw-html:`<img src="xkcd-a_new_captcha_approach.png"></img>`
:raw-latex:`\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{xkcd-a_new_captcha_approach.png}`


Just be sure to have read beforehand the `Sim-Diasca Troubleshooting`_ section.

If the issue remains, then probably that some support could help.

However, surely that, rather than reporting "this does not work!", we would prefer a more detailed bug report, mentioning at least:

 - your version of Sim-Diasca and of other tools (including Erlang)
 - your platform (hardware and software)
 - the detailed error message (preferably including stack trace, context and prior outputs, even if it is long)
 - the trace output, i.e. the full trace file (ex: ``my_case_test.traces``), which is a very valuable source of troubleshooting information



Simplest approach is to double-check your problem and then contact directly the maintainer, Olivier Boudeville:

 - preferably by email: `olivier.boudeville@edf.fr <mailto:olivier.boudeville@edf.fr>`_
 - otherwise by phone: preferably in French, otherwise in English: ``+33147655958``


Support will be done on a best-effort basis (no commercial support available).
