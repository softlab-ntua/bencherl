Recommended next actions would then be:

 #. read the (much shorter) *Sim-Diasca Developer Guide*
 #. write your own test models, getting inspiration from the *Sim-Diasca Mock Simulators* examples (see the top-level ``mock-simulators`` directory in the source archive)


We hope that you will enjoy using Sim-Diasca. As always, any (constructive!) feedback is welcome (use `this email address <mailto:olivier.boudeville@edf.fr>`_ for that). Thanks!
